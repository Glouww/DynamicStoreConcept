This is a dynamic grocery store website concept developed for an assessment for the "(CSC-30025) Avdanced Web Technologies module". 
This project aimed to conceptualise and implement a functional online grocery store 
using HTML/CSS, PHP, JavaScript and MySQL. The system was required to 
support multiple features, including secure user registration and login with 
CAPTCHA verification, dynamic product browsing through category-based 
dropdown menus, and the ability for users to place orders. Additionally, a RESTful 
API was used to implement a secure admin interface which could retrieve customer 
order data.
